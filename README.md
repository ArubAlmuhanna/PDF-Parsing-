# PDF Parsing Using Python:
Although PDF files can include a large amount of data, they are usually hard to manipulate. Therefore, in this project I share how I extracted the raw data from a PDF file and saved it into a tabular format. As a result, I was able to store all the data I needed in one table. Furthermore, it was easy to analyse the data and extract actionable insights. 

# In this Projec project:
I used Python to parse a PDF file. My main goal was to extract multiple tables from the PDF, merge them into one and save the output in CSV format.

# Files:
## Input File
Recommended Food Storage Times Cold and Dry Refrigerated and Frozen Foods.PDF
